# Extended Realities (XR), Winter Semester 2025-2026

<br/><br/>
**Syllabus**

In this course we will look into XR technologies and the real-time engines that underpin them, as well as be introduced to theoretical concepts surrounding the notion of “immediacy” and hybrid storytelling. Students will gain an overview of these technologies, their history and use in the creative disciplines. We will consider in detail some design criteria for VR and AR, as well as appropriate technologies and workflows, through looking at examples from the fields of art, games, immersive experiences and apps. On the technical side, students will gain hands-on experience with a game engine (Unity) and be asked to create a VR or AR prototype in response to a given theme/topic.

<br/><br/>
**Learning Objectives**

- Gain an understanding of the cultural, historical, and political context for the development of real-time technologies, particularly in the area of XR
- Understand how real-time engines are structured and how they interface with other hardware and software
- Understand and be able to implement a basic architecture for real-time experiences in Unity, particularly in the area of XR
- Be able to recognise design criteria specific to XR and develop your own specific to an experience you may want to build
- Design and develop your own XR prototype experience

<br/><br/>
**Method of Instruction**

- Lectures/discussion-based activities
- Tech demos
- Personal projects

<br/><br/>
*Day 1 (7.11.)*

Extended Realities

- theoretical introduction: interactive/hybrid narration, immediacy and hypermediacy in art and technology
- A brief history of XR and immersive technologies
- Real Time Technologies and their field of use + Examples

Game Engines - For beginners with little or no game engine experience

- Unity Installation
- Unity Game Engine Introduction Interface
- Unity functionalities (Project Structure, Scene Setup, Assets, Materials, Scripts, External Tools, Debugging, Audio, Video, 3DText)

<br/><br/>
*Day 2 (10.11.)*

Topics in VR/AR

- Video Game Spaces
- Case Studies working with Hybrid Forms of AR/VR
- Overview of VR/AR design challenges 
- Your Projects (Outline, Requirements, First Ideas)

Unity Game Engine and XR

- Further Introduction to Unity Game Engine (UI basics, Post Processing, Collision/trigger, Animator)
- Unity Project Setup for AR / VR
  

<br/><br/>
*Day 3 (17.11.)*

Project/Prototype first steps

- Mini-Pitch of your Project Idea
- Setup for VR/AR development (VR goggles working; AR workflow setup)
- Interaction Examples in AR /VR

- Design/Storyboard/Wireframe VR / AR experience
- Develop a VR or AR Prototype using Unity Game Engine. Prototypes must fulfill a number of criteria in terms of content and interactions (to be defined).

<br/><br/>
*Day 4 (28.11.)*

Project Clinic

We will meet for a morning to cover any special topics, to answer any specific questions concerning technical and dramaturgical aspecs of your projects. (if you would like to cover a specific Unity- or XR-themed topic, let me know until the 24th of November, so I can prepare something)

<br/><br/>
*Day 5 (15.12.)*

Project work

We will meet one final time before you have to hand in your final projects at the end of December. This session is for further questions/collaborative work/polishing of prototypes.

<br/><br/>
**Evaluation**

Evaluation will be based on the personal projects. These projects must be submitted both as an .apk (Oculus Quest, Android)/.exe (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive)/.ipa (iPhone/iPad) and as video walkthrough/demo. The submittion also needs to contain a short description, the storyboard/wireframe and some Screenshots.
