# Extended Realities (XR), Winter Semester 2025-2026

<br/><br/>
**Syllabus**

In this course we will begin to look into XR technologies and the game engines that underpin them. Students will gain an overview of these technologies, their history and use in the creative disciplines, as well as be introduced to theoretical concepts surrounding the notion of the “virtual”. We will consider in detail some design criteria for VR and AR, as well as appropriate technologies and workflows, through looking at and critique of case studies from the fields of art, games, immersive experiences and apps. On the technical side, students will gain hands-on experience with a game engine (Unity) and be asked to create a VR or AR prototype in response to a given theme/topic.

<br/><br/>
**Learning Objectives**

Become acquainted with some of the theoretical debates that guide our understanding of the real and the virtual
Understand how game engines are structured and how they interface with other hardware and software
Understand and be able to implement a basic architecture for real-time experiences in Unity, particularly in the area of XR
Be able to recognise design criteria specific to XR and develop your own specific to an experience you may want to build
Design and develop your own XR prototype experience

<br/><br/>
**Method of Instruction**

- Lectures/discussion-based activities
- Tech demos
- Personal projects

<br/><br/>
**Reading List**

For those who are interested, here is a list of readings/examples etc. that will be added to over time: https://www.are.na/alex-walmsley/virtuality-gczseswa4x8

<br/><br/>
**Topics**

Course preparation: Install latest version of Unity and necessary supporting software

<br/><br/>
*Day 1 (15.10)*

The Virtual and the Real

- Outline of a theoretical basis for understanding the concepts of the “real” and the “virtual” through the lens of media theory and philosophy of technology
- A brief history of XR and immersive technologies
- Everything you need to know about game engines (+ maybe more)
- General XR production pipeline

Game Engines - For beginners with little or no game engine experience

- Installing Unity if you have not already
- Interface tour of Unity and overview of the important components - asset creation and import, setting up a scene, script creation, engine settings, plugins and packaging
- Introduction to further functions - animation, sound, lighting, triggers, optimisation tools
- Installing necessary software for VR/AR development

<br/><br/>
*Day 2 (16.10)*

Topics in VR/AR

- Overview of VR/AR design criteria - what are the important criteria to keep in mind when designing for VR? How do design criteria change with audience? How does VR challenge design criteria for other media?
- Outline a technical workflow for the creation of VR experiences

<br/><br/>
*Day 3 (17.10)*

Project/Prototype first steps

- Get setup for VR/AR development (VR goggles working; AR workflow setup)
- Design/Storyboard/Wireframe VR or AR experience
- Develop a VR or AR Prototype using Unity Game Engine (prompt will be given). Prototypes must fulfill a number of criteria in terms of content and interactions (to be defined).

<br/><br/>
*Day 4 (21.11)*

Project Clinic

We will meet here for a morning to cover any special topics/answer any specific questions you might have (if you would like to cover a specific Unity- or XR-themed topic, let me know a few weeks in advance and I can prepare something)

<br/><br/>
*Day 5 (21.01)*

Project work

We will meet one final time before you have to hand in your final projects at the beginning of February. This session is for further questions/collaborative work/polishing of prototypes.

<br/><br/>
**Evaluation**

Evaluation will be based on the personal projects. These projects must be submitted both as an .apk (Oculus Quest, Android)/.exe (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive)/.ipa (iPhone/iPad) and as video walkthrough/demo.
